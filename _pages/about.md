Hi, I am a Ph.D student in System Engineering at Boston University, supervised by Prof. [Francesco Orabona](http://francesco.orabona.com). I am a member of [OPTIMAL Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/optimal-lab/home). 

My research interests lie in theoretical machine learning and stochastic optimization. I currently work on understanding and designing optimization methods in machine learning, specifically, stochastic gradient descent and its variants, and adaptive gradient descent methods.   

I was a Ph.D candidate at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu). Before that, I received my Bachelor degree in Math and Applied Math from [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn).
